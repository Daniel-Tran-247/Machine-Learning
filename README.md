# 🧠 Machine-Learning-Notes

🙋‍ Welcome to my ML repos. These are the lecture notes and exercises I have done when I took the some of the ML course from ```365 Data Science``` and ```Coursera```.

## 1. Used Car Price Prediction 🚗

🎯 Predict the price of different used cars using ***Multiple Linear Regression*** Model 

[👉 View My Notebook](Linear%20Regression%20-%20Used%20Car%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)

### 🛠️ Preprocessing 
- Expore the descriptive statistics of the variables 
- Remove/ Input ```Missing Values```
- ```Probability Density Function``` of each variable of interest
- Remove ```oulier```/ ```abnormal value```
- Checking Ordinary Least Square ```assumption``` 
(Apply ```Log Transformation``` to make distribution of a variable more normally distributed;
Apply ```Variance Inflation Factor``` to check ```Multicollinearity```
- Creat dummy variables 

### 🚀 Build & Evalutate Model Performace
- Declare the inputs and targets
- Feature scalling (```Standardization```)
- Train Test split
- Create a Regression model
- Check performance (Using the ```Residuals PDF``` and ```R-squared```)

## 2. US House Price Prediction 🏡

🎯 Predict the Price of the US House using ***Multiple Linear Regression*** Model

⚙️ I used same techniques as I did in the ```Used Car Price Prediction```.
